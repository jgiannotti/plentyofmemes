# Netlify configuration for PlentyOfMemes

# This configuration tells Netlify how to build and deploy the site.
# The build command runs a small shell script that replaces the
# Supabase placeholders in our static HTML with actual values from
# Netlify environment variables.  The resulting files are then
# published from the `public` directory.

[build]
  # Run our build script to inline Supabase environment variables
  command = "bash scripts/build.sh"
  # Directory to publish after build completes
  publish = "public"
